# Java-CardGameApp

This is the second project I undertook during week 9 of the 16 week CodeClan immersive programming course. 
The brief is shown below -

```
Card game

Goal: Create a card game in Android.

We recommend something reasonably straight forward like BlackJack.
The logic for your app will be in Java classes and you can use the methods in these classes in Android activites to create a UI.

MVP

The game does not need to have much or any interaction. The aim is to display the results of the Java logic.
For example, if you had two players being dealt two cards each your screen might look something like:

  Player 1: Ace of Hearts, 9 of Diamonds
  Player 2: 3 of Clubs, 2 of Hearts

  Player 1 Wins!
  
  
Project Extensions

Possibly add another card game
Improve the UI
```


I implemented a card game app which allows a user to select between 2 card games; Blackjack or Highest card.
The core game logic was developed via TDD in plain Java. 
I then transferred this logic into an Android project with a full UI.
